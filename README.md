**REMEMBER:**
- ensure you commit your code after every major change, to keep your history and not loose anything
```console
  git add -A
  git commit -m "𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑡 𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒"
  git push origin main
```

**NOTES ON INITIAL LOAD for C/C++:**
- ensure the C/C++ extension is loaded correctly (you might need to reload it)
- when you run or debug a C/C++ program for the first time, the IDE will ask what compiler to use; select the 1st choice (C/C++: gcc)
- the IDE will place a task.json file in the .vscode directory
